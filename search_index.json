The difference between a random mating population and inbred population is the way \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is constructed. So for a pair of individuals \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), \\[G_{ij}=\\frac{1}{\\tilde{m}}\\sum_l^{\\tilde{m}}\\frac{(x_{il}-2p_l)(x_{jl}-2p_l)}{2(1+F)p_lq_l}\\] and \\(F=1\\) for inbred lines. Please refer to Chapter 1. Conducting eigenanalysis for \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), see it definition (??). Linear regression analysis for each SNP. 2.2 Protocal for EigenGWAS A simple analysis pipeline written in Rscripts may be found at Rpub and its Shiny demo. Or, try it as below in RStudio runGitHub(&quot;Rshiny&quot;, &quot;gc5k&quot;) 2.3 Protocol for predicted eigenvectors The prediction accuracy can be written as \\[R^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{n_e}{m}}\\] 2.4 Nucleotide diversity \\(\\theta\\), the normalized observed number of variants sites \\(\\pi\\), the observed heterozygosity per base pair Nonetheless, we can expect that favored alleles will generally sit whthin large shared haplotypes, and that these haplotypes will be in sharp contrast with more variable haplotypes on the unselected background. Voight, et al, PLoS Biology, 2006, 4, e72. However, the excess variability around the site of F/S amino-acid polymorphism is found within S haplotypes, and F haplotypes are depauperate in variability, suggesting that the F allele is a derived variant that has recently swept to an intermediate frequency.
