Consequently, we can implement Fisher’s Exact test for this table. However, given the current biotechnology, \\(D\\) is often unknown. But given the correlation, \\(\\rho_{1,2}\\), of a pair of markers, we know that \\[\\rho_{1,2}=\\frac{D_{1,2}}{\\sqrt{P_AP_aP_BP_b}}\\] In simulation, it is very easy to simulate LD given the correlation. Calculate \\(D_{1,2}=\\rho_{1,2}\\sqrt{P_AP_aP_BP_b}\\) first. Depending on the allele at locus 1, the probabilities of observing allele \\(B\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(P(B|A)=\\frac{P_{AB}}{P_{A}} =\\frac{P_A\\times P_B+D}{P_A}\\), \\(P(b|A)=1-P(B|A)\\), \\(P(b|a)=\\frac{P_{ab}}{P_a} =\\frac{P_a\\times P_b+D}{P_a}\\), and \\(P(B|a)=1-P(B|a)\\), respectively. So, the recombination can be defined as \\(\\frac{P(B|A)}{P(B|A) + P(b|A)}=P_B + \\frac{D}{P_A}\\). 7.2 The maximal value \\(\\rho_{AB}\\) Assuming \\(P_A \\leq P_B \\leq 0.5\\), the maximal of \\(\\rho_{l_1l_2}\\) reaches when allele \\(A\\) is \\(a\\) subset of \\(B\\) linage so that \\(P_{AB}=P_{A}\\), because (see PLoS Genet 2(9): e142) \\[\\rho_{1,2}=\\frac{P_{AB}-P_{A}P_{B}}{\\sqrt{P_A P_a P_B P_b}}=\\frac{P_A(1-P_B)}{\\sqrt{P_A P_a P_B P_b}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{P_AP_b}{P_B P_a}} \\leq 1\\] The maxima of \\(D=min(P_AP_b, P_BP_a)\\). 7.3 LD and recombination fraction It is sometimes useful to simulate \\(F_2\\) population given known LD between any pair of markers. Below is the procedure for doing that. For a pair of loci, the correlation is the function of their recombination function \\[\\rho_{1,2}=1-2c_{1,2}\\] In addition, the correlation is also the function of LD \\[\\rho_{1,2}=\\frac{D_{1,2}}{\\sqrt{P_AP_aP_BP_b}}\\] So given the allele frequency of 0.5 and the markers are evenly distributed, \\(c_{1,2}=0.5-2D_{1,2}\\), and their corresponding genetic distance is \\(d_{1,2}=-\\frac{1}{2}ln(1-2c_{1,2})=-\\frac{1}{2}ln(4D_{1,2})\\) given Haldane map function. Under the Haldane map function, the recombination between locus 1 and 3 is \\(c_{1,3}=\\frac{1}{2}[1-e^{-2(d_{1,2}+d_{2,3})}]=\\frac{1}{2}[1-e^{2ln(4D_{1,2})}]\\) Then the correlation between the locus 1 and 3 is \\(\\rho_{1,3}=1-2c_{1,3}=e^{2ln(4D_{1,2})}\\) And, their corresponding LD is \\(D_{1,3}=\\sqrt{P_AP_aP_BP_b}e^{ln(4D_{1,2})}=0.25e^{2ln(4D_{1,2})}\\) In general, \\(D_{l_1l_2}=0.25e^{|l_1-l_2|ln(4D_{1,2})}\\).
